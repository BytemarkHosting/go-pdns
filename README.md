*******
Simple Go libraries to interact with PowerDNS ( https://www.powerdns.com/ ).

Currently contains an implementation of the powerdns-pipebackend protocol and a
library to ease developing backends in Go. See pipe/dsl/dsl.go for usage
examples.

APIs / etc are not set in stone yet, patches welcome.
